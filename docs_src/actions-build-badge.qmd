## üîé What is it?

- It is a **dynamic status badge** that is automatically generated by **GitHub Actions**.  
- It shows the status of the Continuous Integration (CI) workflow that you‚Äôve configured in your repo under `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.  
- If the pipeline runs successfully (compiles and passes tests), the badge will appear in **green** with something like `‚úî passing`.  
- If it fails, it will turn **red** with `‚úñ failing`.  

***

## ‚öôÔ∏è How does it work?

1. In your repo, create a **workflow** (a YAML file inside `.github/workflows/`).  
   Minimal example for **Java + Maven**:

   ```yaml
   name: CI

   on:
     push:
       branches: [ "main" ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ "main" ]

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v3

         - name: Set up JDK 17
           uses: actions/setup-java@v3
           with:
             distribution: 'temurin'
             java-version: '17'

         - name: Build with Maven
           run: mvn -B package --file pom.xml
   ```

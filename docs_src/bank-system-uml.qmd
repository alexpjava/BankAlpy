 title: "Bank System UML"
---
## Overview
This page shows a **UML Class Diagram** for a **Bank System**. The diagram helps us understand how the different parts of a banking system work together.

A **UML Class Diagram** is a way to visually show the main entities in a system, their attributes (information they store), and how they are connected. It’s like a blueprint of the system’s data.

The diagram includes classes like:

- **Customer** – represents people who have accounts in the bank.
- **Account** – shows details about each bank account, such as the balance and type.
- **Currency** and **AccountType** – describe what kind of money and account are used.
- **BankTransaction** – records the money movements (like deposits or withdrawals).
- **Loan** – represents money borrowed by a customer.

There are also linking classes like **AccountCustomer** and **CurrencyAccountType** that connect the main parts together.

This diagram gives a clear picture of how data is organized in a bank system and how the different parts are related.

# üß± MVC Architecture in a Java Banking Project (Without Spring Boot)

This document explains the **Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìController (MVC)** architecture pattern using **plain Java and Maven**, before introducing frameworks like Spring Boot.  
Understanding this foundation will help to design clean, modular, and maintainable backend systems.

This project is a simple **banking system** built with **Java**, **Maven**, and an **H2** in-memory database.
It follows the **MVC (Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìController)** architectural pattern to organize the code cleanly and maintainably.

## üß© MVC Structure

**MVC** stands for:
- **Model** ‚Äì Represents the data and business logic (e.g., `Account`, `Customer`, `Loan`, `Transaction`).
- **View** ‚Äì Displays information (in this backend project, it could be a console interface or an API output).
- **Controller** ‚Äì Receives user input, calls the model‚Äôs services, and sends back the response to the view.

## üîπ 1. Model (M)

These are your **data classes** and everything related to data
persistence.\
In your case: `Account`, `Customer`, `Loan`, `BankTransaction`.\
Here you only define the attributes (e.g., `balance`, `loanAmount`) and
relationships.

Example ‚Äî simple `Account` model:

```java
public class Account {
    private int id;
    private String owner;
    private double balance;

    // Constructor, getters, setters, and business logic
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) balance -= amount;
    }
}
```

The model can interact with data sources such as files, in-memory storage, or a database (like H2).

---

## üîπ 2. View (V)
The **user interface**.\

The **View** is responsible for **displaying information** to the user and receiving inputs.  
Without a web framework, this can be a **console interface** or a GUI (Swing, JavaFX, etc.).

Example ‚Äî console-based `BankView`:

```java
public class BankView {
    public void showBalance(double balance) {
        System.out.println("Your current balance is: " + balance + " ‚Ç¨");
    }

    public void showMessage(String message) {
        System.out.println(message);
    }
}
```

The View should not contain business logic ‚Äî it only handles presentation and user interaction.

---

## üîπ 3. Controller (C)

The **Controller** acts as a **bridge between the View and the Model**.  
It receives user actions, updates the Model, and then refreshes the View with new data.

Example ‚Äî `BankController`:

```java
public class BankController {
    private Account account;
    private BankView view;

    public BankController(Account account, BankView view) {
        this.account = account;
        this.view = view;
    }

    public void makeDeposit(double amount) {
        account.deposit(amount);
        view.showMessage("Deposit completed successfully.");
        view.showBalance(account.getBalance());
    }

    public void makeWithdrawal(double amount) {
        account.withdraw(amount);
        view.showBalance(account.getBalance());
    }
}
```

In `Main.java`, you typically create the objects and connect them:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Account account = new Account();
        BankView view = new BankView();
        BankController controller = new BankController(account, view);

        controller.makeDeposit(100);
        controller.makeWithdrawal(40);
    }
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Business Logic

Business logic defines the **rules and behaviors of the banking domain** ‚Äî not just data storage.

Examples:
- You can‚Äôt make a transfer if the account has insufficient funds.
- When creating a loan, the system must calculate the monthly payment.
- A customer can have multiple accounts.
- 
  **Where does business logic go in MVC?**

Usually, in a **Service layer** that sits between the Controller and the
Model.\
This keeps the Controller clean --- it only handles requests and sends
responses.

1. **Domain Classes (Entities)** ‚Üí `Account`, `Customer`, `Loan`, `Transaction`
    - Hold attributes and simple behaviors.

2. **Service Classes (Business Logic)** ‚Üí `AccountService`, `LoanService`, etc.
    - Contain methods such as `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, `transfer()`, etc.

3. **Repository or DAO Classes (Persistence)** ‚Üí `AccountRepository`, etc.
    - Handle saving and reading data from H2.

## üí° Summary

- **Model:** Holds entities and business logic.
- **Controller:** Mediates between user actions and the model.
- **View:** Displays results to the user.
- **Goal:** Keep responsibilities clear and code modular, preparing for Spring integration later.
